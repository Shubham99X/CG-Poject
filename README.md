# Client Server Implementation in OpenGL
This is a simple Client Server Implementation in C++ using OpenGL and GLUT. This is a menu driven program which allows the user to understand where and what is happening in the background of a Client Server Model using simple graphics implemented through the GLUT library in C++. This helps the user to see where exactly the packets are transferred, thus creating a simulation model. This was used to educate junior students on the basics on Client Server Communication.

# Requirements:
1. GLUT
2. C++ compiler (use MinGW for Windows or any suitable compiler)

To get started run main.cpp in CG Project folder.
